1. mailx
   - is a command-line email client used to send and receive emails. It is a simple utility that provides the ability to compose, send, and receive messages.
   - Common Use: It's primarily used for sending system-generated emails or by users who want to send emails from the command line.
     
3. sendmail
   - It manages the process of routing emails between mail servers and delivering them locally. In the past, it was the default MTA on many UNIX and Linux systems.
   - Common Use: It manages the process of routing emails between mail servers and delivering them locally. In the past, it was the default MTA on many UNIX and Linux systems.
     
5. postfix
   - is a modern and more secure alternative to Sendmail, designed to be simpler and easier to configure.
   - Common Use: Like Sendmail, Postfix handles email routing and delivery but with a focus on ease of use, security, and performance. It is often the default MTA on many modern Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL).
